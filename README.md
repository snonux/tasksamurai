# Task Samurai

Task Samurai is a fast terminal interface for [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) written in Go using the [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) framework. It shows your tasks in a table and lets you manage them without leaving your keyboard.

## Why does this exist?

- I wanted to tinker with agentic coding.
- I wanted a faster UI for Taskwarrior than other options like vit which is Python based.
- I wanted something built with Bubble Tea but never had time to deep dive into it.

## How it works

Task Samurai invokes the `task` command to read and modify tasks. The tasks are displayed in a Bubble Tea table where each row represents a task. Hotkeys trigger Taskwarrior commands such as starting, completing or annotating tasks. The UI refreshes automatically after each action so the table is always up to date.

## Hotkeys

Press `H` to view all available hotkeys.

Example: press `+`, type `Buy milk` and hit Enter to add a new task called "Buy milk".

## Installation

There are two ways to install the `tasksamurai` command:

```bash
go install codeberg.org/snonux/tasksamurai/cmd/tasksamurai@latest
```

Alternatively, clone this repository and run:

```bash
go-task install
```

The second method requires [go-task](https://taskfile.dev/) to be installed.

### Usage

```bash
# Start with default pending tasks
tasksamurai

# Start with a Taskwarrior filter
tasksamurai +tag status:pending
tasksamurai project:work due:today
tasksamurai pri:H

# Any valid Taskwarrior filter can be passed as arguments
```

### Flags

- `--disco`: start Task Samurai in disco mode, changing the theme every time a task is modified.
